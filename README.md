JHU Center for Talented Youth IROB-A/IROB (Introduction to Robotics) MATLAB Examples

LOS (Los Angeles Site) 

Hardware Rquired
1. Lego Mindstorms EV3 Brick (1)
2. EV3 or NXT Motors (s) 
3. EV3 or NXT Touch Sensor (1)

(I used 2 EV3 Medium motors as the adjustment knob and to rotate the fan. Any combination 
of motors (EV3 or NXT) should work fine.

This is code to control a fan that changes speed depending on how much a knob is turned. 
I wrote it as a demonstration for the class to see what using a programming language (even 
if it is proprietary and has a license that can costs as much as a house) to program a 
robot as opposed to using Lego's drag and drop software. I used this code in MATLAb in a 
lecture during class and my students recieved it well. The comments provided should make 
assembly self explanitory.
